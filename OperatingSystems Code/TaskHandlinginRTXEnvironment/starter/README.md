- The Lab3_QA were answered in such a way that we only addressed the question. In other words, we did not write anything that was obvious or verbatim
of what was in the code 

- In our testing, we combined the testing for Part A and part B. So there are tests that cover both part a and part b

- The project was zipped up and emailed to two different computers to make sure the Multi-Project Workspace opened, built and compiled before we submitted.
